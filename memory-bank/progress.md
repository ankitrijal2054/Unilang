## Notes for Next Session

When you resume:

1. ‚úÖ READ ALL MEMORY BANK FILES (start with projectbrief.md)
2. ‚úÖ Review activeContext.md for current focus
3. ‚úÖ Check this progress.md for what's done/remaining
4. ‚úÖ Look at Architecture.md for technical details
5. ‚è≠Ô∏è Follow Tasklist_MVP.md from Phase 2 onwards

**Phase 1 Status:** ‚úÖ 100% COMPLETE
**Ready for:** Phase 2 - Core Messaging Infrastructure
**Next Work:** Start with Firestore services (Chat, Message, User CRUD)

The memory bank is your source of truth. It survives sessions.
