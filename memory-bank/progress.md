## Known Issues & Blockers

### Current Issues

**None** - All planning complete, no code written yet

### Potential Issues (Preventive Measures)

| Issue                                    | Prevention                               | Severity |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Composite index delays                   | Create indexes early in Phase 1          | High     |
| Offline persistence misconfiguration     | Follow Firebase docs carefully           | High     |
| Real-time sync race conditions           | Implement optimistic UI correctly        | High     |
| Network throttling not working           | Use Chrome DevTools, not device settings | Medium   |
| Group member removal bugs                | Comprehensive testing of edge cases      | Medium   |
| Notification permission denial           | Request on app first launch              | Medium   |
| Performance degradation at 100+ messages | Use memoization + batch queries          | Low      |

### Workarounds (If Needed)

1. **Composite index creation slow**

   - Still can test with `array-contains` without ordering (slightly slower)
   - Not ideal but app still functional

2. **Google Sign-In not configured**

   - Fall back to email/password only (still MVP viable)
   - Add Google later

3. **Notifications not working**

   - App still functional for messaging
   - Notifications deferred to later fix

4. **Offline persistence issues**
   - Restart app to refresh from Firestore
   - Not perfect but MVP acceptable

## Notes for Next Session

When you resume:

1. Read ALL memory bank files (start with projectbrief.md)
2. Review activeContext.md for current focus
3. Check this progress.md for what's done/remaining
4. Look at Architecture.md for technical details
5. Follow Tasklist_MVP.md step by step

The memory bank is your source of truth. It survives sessions.
